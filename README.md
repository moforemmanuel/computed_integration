This is a program, which computes the integral of a function and returns it's numerical answer.
The programs if fed with a function  to be integrated as a string, and this is converted to an argument and passed to the integral computing function in the program.
The limits of the function are required as input as well, Making sure they are valid and in a mathematical domain for the inputted function about to be integrated.
A simulation alongside the step by step processes in solving the problem are done, but only the final answer is outputted.
